# PHP_practice
Here’s a list of small PHP projects that are perfect for beginners. These projects will help you learn the basics of PHP and web development while also giving you practical experience:

1. Basic Calculator
Create a simple calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
Input: Two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /).
Output: The result of the operation.
2. User Registration Form
Build a user registration form with fields like username, email, and password.
Use PHP to validate the inputs (e.g., check if the email is valid, the password is strong enough).
Store the form data in a simple text file or a MySQL database.
3. To-Do List Application
Create a simple to-do list where users can add, update, and delete tasks.
Use sessions to store the data, or use a database if you're comfortable.
4. Contact Form with Email Sending
Build a contact form with fields like name, email, and message.
Use PHP’s mail() function to send the form data to an email address.
Include validation for required fields.
5. Simple Blog
Create a simple blog where users can add posts and view them on the homepage.
Include a form for adding new posts, storing posts in a file or database, and displaying them.
Optionally, add a way to delete or edit posts.
6. Login/Logout System
Create a basic login and logout system using PHP sessions.
Use a hard-coded username and password or store them in a database.
Redirect the user to a welcome page after successful login and provide a logout button.
7. Random Quote Generator
Display a random quote every time the page is refreshed.
Store quotes in an array or a text file.
Optionally, allow users to submit new quotes and save them.
8. File Upload System
Build a form that allows users to upload a file (e.g., an image or document).
Validate the file type and size before storing it in a directory.
Display a list of uploaded files with download links.
9. Temperature Converter
Create a simple form to input a temperature (Celsius or Fahrenheit) and convert it to the other unit.
Implement the conversion logic in PHP and display the result.
10. Currency Converter
Build a currency converter that takes an amount in one currency and converts it to another.
Use hardcoded exchange rates for simplicity or fetch live rates from an API if you're up for a challenge.
11. Image Gallery
Create a simple image gallery where users can upload images, and they will be displayed in a grid.
Implement basic file upload validation (e.g., image size and type).
12. Survey/Poll System
Build a small survey or poll system where users can vote on a topic.
After voting, display the results in the form of a percentage or a bar chart.
13. Simple Shopping Cart
Create a basic shopping cart where users can add items to their cart and see a total price.
Use sessions to store cart data and display it across multiple pages.
14. Number Guessing Game
Build a number guessing game where the user guesses a randomly generated number.
Provide feedback (too high, too low) and allow the user to try again until they guess correctly.
15. Form with Data Validation
Create a form with multiple fields (name, email, phone number, etc.).
Validate the inputs (e.g., check for valid email format, non-empty fields, etc.).
Display error messages for invalid inputs and process the form if valid.
These projects are small but will help you get comfortable with PHP syntax, handling forms, working with sessions, and connecting to a database. You can start with the simpler ones and move to more complex projects as your skills improve.
